  1. Keeping the Momentum Going: The Strategy

  Your 6-month runway is a gift. The goal is to use this time to build a
  compelling case for investors, so you're fundraising based on traction and
  progress, not desperation.

  Your narrative is key: "The government has validated our vision and de-risked
  the next 6 months of development. We are now raising a round to scale the
  significant progress we are about to make."

  2. A Task System for Direction (The Next 6 Months)

  Think of this as a 3-phase plan. Create a simple project board (using Trello,
  Asana, or even a spreadsheet) with these tasks.

  Phase 1: Foundation & Preparation (Months 1-2)

  The goal here is to get your house in order so you can execute flawlessly
  later.

   * Task: Solidify Your Narrative & Story.
       * Why: This is the core of your pitch. Why this team? Why this problem?
         Why now? What is the massive vision?
       * Action: Write it down. Practice telling it. Every team member should be
         able to tell the same compelling story.

   * Task: Create Your "Target Investor" List.
       * Why: Fundraising is not about spraying and praying. It's about finding
         the right partners.
       * Action: Create a spreadsheet (your fundraising CRM). List 50-100
         potential investors (VCs and Angels). Track:
           * Fund/Name
           * Investment Thesis (Do they invest in your sector/stage?)
           * Key Partner
           * Connection Path (How can you get a warm intro?)
           * Status (Researched, Contacted, Meeting, Passed, etc.)

   * Task: Build the Pitch Deck v1.
       * Why: This is the key that unlocks the first meeting.
       * Action: Create a concise, 12-15 slide deck. Standard slides include:
         Problem, Solution, Market Size, Product, Traction, Business Model, Team,
         The Ask/Use of Funds.

   * Task: Prepare Your Data Room.
       * Why: Serious investors will ask for it. Being prepared shows
         professionalism.
       * Action: Create a folder (Google Drive, Dropbox) with key documents:
         Corporate registration, the grant agreement, cap table, detailed
         financial projections (3 years), team bios, product demos.

  Phase 2: Traction & "Soft" Networking (Months 2-4)

  Use the grant money to hit milestones. This is your proof.

   * Task: Execute on 1-2 Key Metrics.
       * Why: Traction is the best form of validation.
       * Action: Depending on your startup, go all-in on:
           * Product: Ship a key feature that users have been asking for.
           * Users/Customers: Acquire your first 100/1000 users or 5-10 paying
             customers.
           * Revenue: Generate your first $1k-$10k in revenue.
           * Hit the milestones defined in your grant proposal.

   * Task: Begin "Advice" Meetings.
       * Why: You build relationships before you need the money.
       * Action: Reach out to experienced founders and friendly investors from
         your target list. The angle is crucial: "We're not fundraising yet, but
         I deeply respect your experience in [their expertise]. We're currently
         funded by a grant and are figuring out our scaling strategy. Could I
         borrow 20 minutes of your time for advice?"

   * Task: Refine Pitch Deck & Financials (v2).
       * Why: Incorporate the feedback from your advice meetings and add your new
         traction data.
       * Action: Update your deck with real metrics. Your financial model is now
         based on real data, not just guesses.

  Phase 3: Active Fundraising (Months 4-6)

  Now you flip the switch.

   * Task: Execute Systematic Outreach.
       * Why: A structured process creates momentum and the perception of a "hot"
         round.
       * Action: Go to your CRM. Systematically pursue warm introductions to your
         top-tier target investors. Aim to bunch your first meetings closely
         together.

   * Task: Run a Tight Process.
       * Why: This creates FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).
       * Action: When an investor shows interest, be transparent and say, "Great,
         we're moving towards a second round of meetings in two weeks." Keep the
         process moving. Follow up politely but persistently.

  3. Good Resources for Learning Fundraising

  Here are some of the best, no-fluff resources.

   * Google Web Search: I can perform a targeted search for you. For example, I
     can search for "Y Combinator guide to fundraising" or "venture capital blogs
     for early stage startups".

   * Blogs & Essays (Required Reading):
       * Paul Graham's Essays: The founder of Y Combinator. His essays on startups
         are foundational. Start with "How to Raise Money."
       * NFX (nfx.com): Incredible, detailed essays on fundraising strategy,
         network effects, and pitch decks. Their "Fundraising Bible" is a
         goldmine.
       * First Round Review (review.firstround.com): Extremely tactical, in-depth
         articles. Search for "fundraising" and you'll find masterclasses on
         everything from pitch decks to data rooms.
       * Fred Wilson (avc.com): A legendary VC. His daily blog offers a long-term
         perspective on the market and what investors look for.

   * Books:
       * "Venture Deals: Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist" by
         Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson: This is the bible. It explains term
         sheets and the mechanics of a deal in plain English. Read it before you
         get your first term sheet.
       * "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries: While not strictly about fundraising,
         it teaches the methodology of building a capital-efficient,
         traction-focused company, which is exactly what investors want to fund.

   * Communities & Video Content:
       * Y Combinator's YouTube Channel: Hours of free, world-class advice from
         partners and successful founders on every aspect of starting up,
         including fundraising.
       * Local Startup Meetups: Find local events. The connections you make in
         person can be invaluable.
