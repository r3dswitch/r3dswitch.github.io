"How to Feel," delves into the often-overlooked aspect of emotional dysregulation in ADHD. The author describes the experience of being 'flooded' by intense emotions, which can be overwhelming and lead to disproportionate reactions. The chapter explains that while not a part of the formal diagnostic criteria, difficulty with emotional regulation is a core feature of ADHD. It discusses how this can lead to a tendency to suppress or avoid feelings, which in turn can cause further psychological distress. The toolbox section offers strategies for managing these intense emotions, including learning to label feelings, making space for them without judgment, using emotions as a source of information and motivation, and finding emotional balance through various techniques. The chapter concludes with the author's personal story of coming to terms with her own emotional intensity, and the empowering realization that learning to feel her emotions, rather than suppress them, was a crucial step in her journey.
