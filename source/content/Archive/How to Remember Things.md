"How to Remember Stuff," tackles the pervasive issue of forgetfulness for people with ADHD. The author humorously admits to initially forgetting to even write this chapter. The chapter clarifies that the primary memory challenge in ADHD is not with long-term storage but with working memory and the encoding of new information. It explains that working memory in ADHD has fewer "slots" for holding information, making it difficult to remember things just heard or read. The chapter also delves into the concept of poor "free recall," which is the ability to remember something without a cue, leading to the common "out of sight, out of mind" experience. The toolbox section offers a variety of strategies to compensate for these memory deficits. These include using external "assistants" like calendars and to-do lists, reducing the load on working memory by using visual aids and monotasking, improving the encoding process through active learning techniques, and using cues effectively. The chapter concludes on a positive note, finding the "joy of forgetting" in the opportunities for rediscovery and creativity that it can bring.
