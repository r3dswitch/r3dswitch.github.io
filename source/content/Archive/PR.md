# Big step in the digitalization of chronic wound treatment

Through digitalization with Zenecare's Wound Management platform, Charite has not only set a benchmark for diabetic foot ulcer care, but also simultaneously improved the quality of life of 100s of patients, generating transparent insights and compliant documentation.

A nurse performs photo documentation using the integrated Zenecare app, the platform generates detailed documentation and reports interacting with the hospital system, the doctor has detailed insight and the nurse has in their fingertips woundcare treatment suggestions approved by the doctor. 

With aging population and declining number of caregivers, digitalization in healthcare is inevitable. Nevertheless, chronic wounds which affect 10% of elderly have only surface level solutions that drain healthcare providers time and money. 

The modular platform Zenecare is therefore used at the Charite Hospital in Berlin. This platform not only enables user-friendly and in-depth digitalization of patient treatment, but also contributes to the success of current AI research projects with its automatically generated data.

## After a successful launch in the Clinic and Polyclinic for Diabetology, the new software is now being rolled out across the entire clinic

_Dr. X and PD Dr. Y are working on a new algorithm for understanding evolution of chronic wounds based on the structured image and metadata collected in the clinic and at home.  

After the pilot project with the Zenecare software was successfully established for several months in the diabetology clinic, one of the busiest clinics with over 10,000 patients per year, it is currently being rolled out to the other clinics of the Charite Hospital.Â 

"By implementing Avelios, we have become significantly more efficient and, thanks to features such as the automated generation of reports and line of therapies, have been able to significantly improve the quality of treatment. In addition, we have already been able to automatically generate numerous structured treatment data for our research," says Prof. Dr. X.

With the planned hospital-wide deployment of the platform, digitalization at Charite is taking a major step forward: "For me, the conclusion is: Zenecare's modular platform approach is technically modern, groundbreaking, and well-thought-out. It integrates into the existing IT infrastructure with flexible and free interfaces. The potential for networking with modern software solutions, apps, and devices was one of the decisive criteria for its use in our outpatient clinics," says Dr. Y.

Prof. Dr. X, emphasizes: "With the expansion of the software to additional clinics at the hospital, we will have access to structured data on tens of thousands of treatments annually across all disciplines. The upcoming consolidation of this data in our Data Integration Center and policy shift in EHR records will not only enable us to answer questions about our treatment outcomes and the quality of care, but also to use artificial intelligence to develop real time decision making and support systems for clinical work."  

John Doe mentions how he had to once center his life around his wound but no longer needs to anymore, because it is cared for regularly and he can have peace of mind by checking it himself and knowing that the suggestions are the ones his doctor approves.
