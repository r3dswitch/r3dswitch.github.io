The author describes her own chaotic relationship with sleep and notes that a high percentage of people with ADHD experience sleep disorders. The chapter identifies several co-existing conditions like restless leg syndrome and delayed sleep phase syndrome. It explores reasons why people with ADHD struggle with sleep, including a natural tendency towards a later chronotype, issues with stimulation at bedtime, and revenge bedtime procrastination. The chapter stresses that adequate sleep is not optional but essential for managing ADHD symptoms. The toolbox section offers practical advice, such as prioritizing sleep, practicing good sleep hygiene (with ADHD-friendly modifications), creating motivating bedtime rituals, understanding and working with one's chronotype, and developing backup plans for nights of poor sleep. The chapter concludes by challenging the societal pressure to be an early riser and advocating for accepting and accommodating different sleep patterns.
