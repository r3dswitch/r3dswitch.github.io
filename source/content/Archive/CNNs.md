 **Convolutional Filters:**

* Explains the core concept of **convolutional filters** (or kernels) as small learnable matrices that detect specific features in images.

* Introduces **feature detectors** and how they respond to patterns in their **receptive fields**.

* Discusses **translation equivariance**, a property of convolutions where the output shifts predictably with input translations.

* Explains **padding** (e.g., 'same' padding) to control the output size of feature maps.

* Covers **strided convolutions** for down-sampling feature maps.

* Introduces **multi-dimensional convolutions** for processing images with multiple channels (e.g., RGB).

 **Pooling:**

* Explains **pooling** (e.g., **max-pooling** and **average pooling**) as a technique to reduce the dimensionality of feature maps and introduce local translation invariance.

* Discusses **max-unpooling** as an inverse operation for up-sampling.

 **Multilayer Convolutions:**

* Describes how multiple convolutional layers can be stacked to learn hierarchical features, with later layers having larger **effective receptive fields**.

* Introduces **1x1 convolutions** for changing the number of channels.

* Discusses **example network architectures** like LeNet and VGG-16, highlighting their design principles and the scale of parameters.

 **Visualizing Trained CNNs:**

* Explores methods for understanding what trained CNNs have learned, including visualizing **Gabor filters** in early layers.

* Introduces **saliency maps** to identify important regions in an image for a given classification.

* Discusses **adversarial attacks** as small, imperceptible perturbations that can cause misclassification.

* Covers **synthetic images** generated by maximizing unit activations in trained networks.

 **Object Detection:**

* Explains **bounding boxes** for localizing objects in images.

* Introduces **Intersection-over-Union (IoU)** as a metric for evaluating bounding box accuracy.

* Discusses **sliding windows** as a traditional approach for object detection and its computational challenges.

* Covers **Fast Region CNNs** as more efficient methods for object detection.

* Explains **non-max suppression** for eliminating redundant bounding box detections.

* Discusses **detection across scales** to handle objects of various sizes.

 **Image Segmentation:**

* Introduces **image segmentation**, where each pixel is classified individually.

* Covers **convolutional segmentation** and **up-sampling** techniques (e.g., transpose convolutions) to restore spatial resolution.

* Explains the **U-net architecture** as a common model for semantic segmentation.

 **Style Transfer:**

* Introduces **neural style transfer** as a technique to combine the content of one image with the style of another.
