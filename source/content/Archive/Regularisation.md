   ****Inductive Bias:****

    *   Explains the concept of ****inductive bias**** (or prior knowledge) as the assumptions a learning algorithm makes to generalize from finite training data.

    *   Discusses ****inverse problems**** in machine learning, where the goal is to infer an underlying process from observed data.

    *   Introduces the ****no free lunch theorem****, which states that no single learning algorithm is universally superior across all possible problems.

    *   Explores how ****symmetry and invariance**** (e.g., translation invariance) can be incorporated as inductive biases.

    *   Discusses ****equivariance**** as a generalization of invariance, where the output transforms predictably with input transformations.

   ****Weight Decay:****

    *   Introduces ****weight decay**** (L2 regularization) as a common regularization technique that penalizes large weight values, effectively shrinking them towards zero.

    *   Discusses ****consistent regularizers**** that preserve desirable transformation properties of network mappings.

    *   Explores ****generalized weight decay**** and its connection to sparse models (e.g., Lasso).

   ****Learning Curves:****

    *   Explains ****learning curves**** as plots of training and validation error versus iteration number, providing insights into model complexity and overfitting.

    *   Introduces ****early stopping**** as a regularization technique where training is halted when validation error starts to increase.

    *   Discusses the phenomenon of ****double descent****, where test error initially decreases, then increases (critical regime), and then decreases again for very large models.

   ****Parameter Sharing:****

    *   Explains ****parameter sharing**** (or weight tying) as a technique to reduce network complexity by forcing groups of weights to have the same value.

    *   Introduces ****soft weight sharing**** as a more flexible approach where a regularization term encourages groups of weights to have similar values.

   ****Residual Connections:****

    *   Introduces ****residual connections**** (skip connections) as an architectural modification that helps train very deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily.

    *   Discusses the ****shattered gradients**** problem in very deep networks without residual connections.

   ****Model Averaging:****

    *   Explores ****model averaging**** (ensembles) as a technique to improve generalization by combining predictions from multiple models.

    *   Discusses ****bootstrap aggregation (bagging)**** as a method for creating multiple datasets to train diverse models.

   ****Dropout:****

    *   Introduces ****dropout**** as a widely used regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of hidden units to zero during training, effectively averaging over many subnetworks.
