"How to People," explores the social difficulties often experienced by individuals with ADHD. The author shares her personal struggles with social awkwardness and the challenges of making and maintaining friendships. The chapter introduces the "circle of support" concept, highlighting how people with ADHD may have a smaller social circle, leading to over-reliance on a few individuals. It delves into the reasons for these social challenges, including missing social cues, emotional dysregulation, and the impact of past rejection on one's mindset. The chapter also discusses the "double empathy problem," where misunderstandings arise from the differing experiences of neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals. The toolbox section offers practical advice for improving social connections, such as identifying one's own strengths, meeting new people in comfortable settings, consciously leveling up social skills, making socializing a routine, and clearly communicating personal boundaries. The chapter concludes with the idea that friendship is a process of building connection over time, and the goal is to find a sense of belonging rather than simply being liked.
