**Discrete Distributions:**


* **Bernoulli Distribution:** Models the outcome of a single trial with two possible outcomes (e.g., a coin flip).

* **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.

* **Multinomial Distribution:** Generalizes the binomial distribution to trials with more than two possible outcomes.

  
**Continuous Distributions:**

  
* **The Multivariate Gaussian:** A detailed exploration of the multivariate Gaussian (or normal) distribution, a cornerstone of many machine learning models. Key aspects covered include:

* **Geometry of the Gaussian:** Understanding the shape of the distribution through its mean and covariance.

* **Moments:** Calculating the mean and variance.

* **Conditional and Marginal Distributions:** Deriving the distributions of subsets of variables.

* **Bayes' Theorem for Gaussian Variables:** Applying Bayes' theorem in the context of Gaussian distributions.

* **Maximum Likelihood Estimation:** Finding the parameters that best fit the data.

* **Mixtures of Gaussians:** Introducing the concept of combining multiple Gaussian distributions to model more complex data.

 **Periodic Variables:**

* **Von Mises Distribution:** A distribution for periodic variables, analogous to the Gaussian distribution for linear variables.

* **The Exponential Family:** A broad class of distributions that includes many of the standard distributions (like the Gaussian and Bernoulli) as special cases. The chapter discusses:

* **Sufficient Statistics:** The concept of summarizing data without losing information about the parameters.

* **Nonparametric Methods:** A brief introduction to methods that do not assume a specific functional form for the distribution, including:

 **Histograms**

 **Kernel Densities**

 **Nearest-neighbours**
