This chapter covers **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** and latent variable modeling, focusing on extracting independent source signals from mixed observations.

## Core Concept

**Independent Component Analysis** aims to recover original source signals from their linear mixtures. Given observations **x = Gs** where:

- **x** are the observable mixed signals
- **s** are the unknown independent source signals
- **G** is the unknown mixing matrix

The goal is to find **W = G⁻¹** to recover the sources: **s = Wx**

## Mathematical Framework

The method uses maximum likelihood estimation with the key assumptions:

- Source signals are **statistically independent**
- Sources have **non-Gaussian distributions** (crucial - Gaussian sources cannot be separated)
- Observations are **noise-free linear mixtures**

The likelihood function becomes: **ln P(x|G,H) = ln|det W| + Σᵢ ln pᵢ(Wᵢⱼxⱼ)**

## Learning Algorithms

**Basic Steepest Ascent (Algorithm 34.2):**

1. Linear mapping: **a = Wx**
2. Nonlinear transformation: **zᵢ = φᵢ(aᵢ)** (commonly φ = -tanh)
3. Weight update: **ΔW ∝ [Wᵀ]⁻¹ + zxᵀ**

**Improved Covariant Algorithm (Algorithm 34.4):**

1. Forward pass: **a = Wx**
2. Nonlinearity: **zᵢ = φᵢ(aᵢ)**
3. Backward pass: **x' = Wᵀa**
4. Natural gradient update: **ΔW ∝ W + zx'ᵀ**

## Key Insights

**Choice of Nonlinearity:** The function φ implicitly defines the assumed source distribution:

- φ = -tanh(a) assumes **1/cosh** distribution (heavier-tailed than Gaussian)
- Different φ functions correspond to different source assumptions

**Covariance Principle:** The improved algorithm is dimensionally consistent and converges faster by incorporating curvature information, avoiding matrix inversions while maintaining the same results regardless of measurement units.

**Generative Models:** The chapter illustrates how different source distributions (1/cosh, Cauchy) create different mixture patterns, with heavy-tailed distributions providing clearer separation capabilities.

This approach enables "blind source separation" - recovering original signals from mixtures without knowing the mixing process, with applications in audio processing, biomedical signal analysis, and data preprocessing.
