## Nikita's background [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=0s)

- Nikita launched an app called [TBH](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d591c6a5-ef0d-4c96-be79-3ced67454f54), which went viral and was later sold to [Facebook](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5721b8db-a785-4e07-8bb3-b694f68e62b9), after discovering an app called saraha was the number one app in the United States despite being entirely in Arabic [00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=17s)

- The success of TBH was attributed to identifying latent demand and providing a simpler solution, with the app reaching number one in the United States in six days [00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=38s)

- Nikita emphasizes the importance of designing the user interface and experience, stating that products live and die in the pixels [01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=77s)

## Nikita's early ventures: Politify and Outline [06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=368s)

- Nikita's first product was Politify, a web app that helped users decide who to vote for based on how it would impact their life, which gained four million users during an election season [07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=460s)

- The success of Politify led to the creation of Outline, a company that built similar tools for governments, with contracts from the Governor of [Massachusetts](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/04990795-919f-439e-9b27-9e13de46565f) and the Obama Administration [08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=497s)

- Nikita's experience with Politify and Outline demonstrates his ability to identify and capitalize on latent demand, a skill he has applied to his later ventures [08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=516s)

## Transition to consumer apps [08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=522s)

- The transition to consumer apps was a result of realizing the core competency was in making things that go viral on the internet, not in selling software to governments [08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=522s)

- Building consumer apps helped build a muscle to understand what people want and how to make things grow, with a focus on teens due to their malleable habits [10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=650s)

- Adults are less likely to invite people to new apps, with the number of invitations sent per user dropping 20% for every additional year of age from 13 to 18 [12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=725s)

## The birth of TBH [13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=830s)

- Pivoting to mobile was challenging, requiring a recalibration of how to design and grow apps due to the low margin for error [14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=847s)

- Building apps for teens and identifying consumer product opportunities ultimately led to the development of [TBH](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d591c6a5-ef0d-4c96-be79-3ced67454f54) [15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=927s)

- The success of TBH was preceded by four or five years of trying different ideas, with 15 apps built over the course of the pivot to consumer apps [15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=947s)

## Building for teens vs. adults [16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1007s)

- Building consumer apps for teens is more likely to create network effects because they have a higher urgency to communicate, with the number of people they text growing rapidly from 14 to 18 and peaking around 21 [17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1026s)

- Targeting teens allows apps to ride the upward curve of adding connections to the social graph, increasing the urgency to connect [18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1085s)

- Developing a reproducible testing process is crucial to reduce the risk of failure and increase the probability of success in creating consumer apps [19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1156s)

## TBH’s viral success [20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1202s)

- The app [TBH](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d591c6a5-ef0d-4c96-be79-3ced67454f54) was launched when the company was running low on money, and it immediately took off in the school where it was seeded, with 40% of the school downloading it in the first 24 hours [21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1281s)

- The team used a state-by-state rollout strategy, and when they launched in [California](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/411fc858-0660-4579-8770-bcd22d7b3859), the app became the number one app in the United States [23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1387s)

- The app's success was fueled by its ability to provide a venue for teens to receive positive feedback, with users sending a high volume of messages, including 450,000 messages in the first seven days in one school [28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1702s)

## Viral growth strategy [29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1775s)

- To help the app spread, the team used a strategy of saturating an area with marketing, including running ads and creating a dedicated [Instagram](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/3a441745-3f68-4b93-83a4-502bebc20336) account to follow and engage with students at a particular school [29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1796s)

- The goal was to get a high intensity of adoption and density for the social network to start growing on its own, rather than trying to replicate the strategy at multiple schools [30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1854s)

- The team's approach allowed them to eliminate confounding variables and know immediately whether the app was working or not, with the advice to founders being to figure out a way to eliminate variables so they can know if their test is providing a clear signal [31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1910s)

## Leveraging live chat [32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1940s)

- Testing the ideal version of an app, even if it's manual or non-scalable, helps determine if people care about the product [32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1940s)

- Implementing live chat customer support in an app provides a white-glove experience, eliminates confounding variables, and allows for user research and feedback [32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1978s)

- Live chat is an effective vehicle for getting feedback and doing user research, as users will literally tell you the problems they're having [33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=1996s)

## Lasting lessons from TBH [34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2050s)

- First-time founders who achieve breakout success with a consumer product often underestimate how draining and chaotic it can be, with everything breaking and needing to be substituted [34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2070s)

- It's essential to be ruthless with prioritization and put out the largest fires first as something scales up [35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2113s)

- Product-market fit is a binary concept, and when it's working, it's abundantly obvious, with users fighting to get into the product and new metrics emerging [36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2171s)

## Selling TBH to Facebook [37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2224s)

- Selling a company is a draining process, and working at a large tech company like [Facebook](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5721b8db-a785-4e07-8bb3-b694f68e62b9) can be a significant cultural shift for a founder [37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2224s)

- As a product manager at Facebook, there is a disconnect between product management and design, making it difficult for someone who is used to being involved in the design process [39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2370s)

- Building apps within a large company is much more challenging than as a standalone founder, with more regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles to overcome [41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2460s)

## Big-tech product management [42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2541s)

- People download apps for three main reasons: to make or save money, to find a mate, or to unplug from reality, with subcategories including utilitarian needs like movement, shelter, and more [42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2578s)

- Large companies have distribution advantages, but this can be overcome by startups through paid ads or getting their app into a dense friend graph [44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2656s)

- Incumbent companies often take 12-24 months to respond to competitive threats in the market, giving startups a window of opportunity [45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2749s)

## Nikita on why “product management is not real” [48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2934s)

- Product management in big tech companies can be limited, with product managers separated from the product development process and mainly focused on writing documents and getting approvals [49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=2968s)

- Designers running the show, as seen in companies like [Snapchat](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/76ac3023-d12a-4c7e-898a-38770813f59f) and Apple, can lead to novel products, but also has its own set of problems, including regulatory scrutiny and scaling issues [50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3008s)

- Product managers should be involved in designing the hierarchy, pixels, and flows of a product, especially in zero to one initiatives, rather than being detached from the pixels [51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3080s)

## The Tim Cook painting story [51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3114s)

- A team had a pop art painting of [Tim Cook](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/6b3f7322-c40f-43cf-a781-034c4672cebd) that they kept with them from their old office, which was symbolic of who controlled their destiny, and they eventually had to take it down when they relocated to a new area [52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3150s)

- The painting was a humorous artifact that the team had kept with them, and it was eventually taken down due to its implications [53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3188s)

- The team still has the painting as a reminder of their time at [Facebook](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/5721b8db-a785-4e07-8bb3-b694f68e62b9) [53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3207s)

## Leaving Facebook and starting a new venture [53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3236s)

- After leaving Facebook, there was a desire to start a new venture-backed company that would scale and last many years [54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3254s)

- A post was made to attract teammates and share ideas, which led to a meme about a new app that didn't even exist yet [54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3275s)

- The meme led to a viral moment, and the decision was made to explore building a new app due to market conditions and a desire to make money [55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3313s)

## Rebuilding TBH and overcoming challenges [58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3483s)

- The original [TBH](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/d591c6a5-ef0d-4c96-be79-3ced67454f54) app grew through people sharing messages and text invites, but the regulatory environment had changed, making it necessary to reinvent the growth systems [58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3483s)

- The new version of the app, [Gas](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/7a3e8fcb-16f9-4f8e-a86f-7ccdda198bce), had to be rebuilt with new features and a new growth strategy due to changes in the market and regulations [58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3520s)

- It took about nine launches to figure out how to grow the app again, including renaming it and adding new features [59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3559s)

## Addressing criticism [59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3590s)

- The app's growth system was designed to operate within a compliance framework, avoiding actions that could cause trouble or burn users [59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3590s)

- The goal was to create a positive experience for users, with features like positive communication and affirmations to make teens feel good [01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3803s)

- A system was built to ensure everyone got a vote, spreading love and positivity, which motivated growth and had a significant impact on 10 million kids [01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3842s)

## The human trafficking hoax [01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3868s)

- A hoax started claiming the app was used for human trafficking, which was false and could have killed the company [01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3868s)

- The hoax was fought at every possible vector, including meetings with journalists and insisting on a specific headline to counter the misinformation [01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=3996s)

- Efforts to combat the hoax included removing false reviews, creating a [TikTok](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/712075bc-1676-4331-a1f3-2abee9f65584) video explaining the truth, and relentless effort to reduce account deletions from 3% to 0.1% per day [01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4036s)

## Selling to Discord and lessons learned [01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4197s)

- The app achieved $10 million in sales, 10 million downloads, and was monetized using startup credits, with a focus on negotiating bills down to the last cent of margin for every vendor [01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4216s)

- The app's success on [Twitter](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/c01fc10b-739b-4902-b022-5474e79fd4cb) captured the internet's zeitgeist, leading to the decision to sell it, with three companies interested and ultimately selling to [Discord](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/89ab3fec-1792-40ac-81e0-f86790095e14) [01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4258s)

- The experience taught the importance of being tactical with resources and cash flow, allowing the team to operate without investors [01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4279s)

## Lasting lessons from Gas [01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4299s)

- A key lesson learned is to validate things in a sequence, focusing on one aspect of the product at a time, such as the core flow or virality, to get a clear signal [01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4315s)

- It's essential to execute at 100% for the specific thing being validated, while the rest can be done at a lower level, to avoid scope creep and get a clear signal [01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4333s)

- The approach to consumer product development involves identifying the conditional statements that must be true for the product to work, aiming to condense them to about four key things [01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4370s)

## Building durable consumer apps [01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4396s)

- A hoax about an app being used for human trafficking spread rapidly on [Snapchat](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/76ac3023-d12a-4c7e-898a-38770813f59f), resulting in the app's App Store page being flooded with negative reviews [01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4480s)

- The app was rebranded multiple times, but the hoax continued to resurface, highlighting the difficulty of combating misinformation [01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4520s)

- The naming process of an app can significantly impact its success, with certain names deterring users from inviting friends to join [01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4619s)

## The VC route [01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4958s)

- Building a durable consumer app is extremely challenging, with many apps being compared to "summer songs" that quickly lose popularity [01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4657s)

- The goal of building a viral app can be achievable through science and skill, but creating a durable app is often a matter of luck [01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4773s)

- The decision to go the venture-funded route would depend on the ability to maintain a lean team and scale up while adhering to specific operating principles [01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=4980s)

## Contact permissions in iOS 18 [01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5010s)

- Contact permissions in [iOS 18](https://app.getrecall.ai/item/df684c02-cadd-411f-81ff-56bb88a4cd35) have changed the game for growing apps, making it harder to invite friends, with an average 65% approval rate for contact access [01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5045s)

- The new contact permission screen requires selecting specific contacts to allow app access, which can be time-consuming and may lead to low adoption rates [01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5079s)

- Founders may need to rethink their contact sync strategies and consider alternative methods to connect users, as the current system may entrench incumbents and make it difficult for new apps to emerge [01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5135s)

## The success of Dupe [01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5218s)

- Inverting the time to value is crucial for building a successful consumer social app, where users should experience the "aha moment" within seconds [01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5236s)

- The concept of inverting the time to value involves demonstrating value to users quickly, which can be achieved by cutting unnecessary features and being creative with available tools [01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5348s)

- Extraordinary product people are aware of every possible API and can use them in non-traditional ways to activate users and provide value, such as the URL trick used by Dupe [01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5423s)

## Advice for startup founders [01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5518s)

- Startup founders are advised to look at analytics to understand how people are distributing the app, and identify the milestone that a user must hit to become activated [01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5570s)

- Founders should not separate marketing and product growth, and instead treat them as the same, aligning everything from ads to in-app experience [01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5608s)

- Covering every aspect, from marketing to in-app experience, is necessary for user acquisition and flywheel spin [01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5628s)

## Work with Nikita [01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5658s)

- Nikita works with consumer mobile companies across stages, typically recommending that companies are venture-backed due to the expense [01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5678s)

- His goal is to make companies 10 times their investment back in the first 30 days by identifying growth changes and coupled explanations [01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5698s)

- He shares growth hacks and works closely with companies, often investing in about 10% of the companies that seek his advice [01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&t=5774s)
