## 1. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**

**What it is:**  
A communication model where a client invokes a procedure (function) on a remote server as if it were local. It abstracts network communication details.

**How it works:**

- Client stubs marshal arguments into a network message.
    
- Server stubs unmarshal, execute the procedure, and return results.
    
- Typically uses TCP or UDP.
    

**Use cases:**

- Distributed systems where simplicity is valued (e.g., legacy client-server apps).
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Simple, natural API for developers.
    
- Hides network complexity.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- Tight coupling between client and server.
    
- Poor versioning and interoperability.
    
- Limited web and cross-language support (classic RPC is mostly legacy now).

## 2. **CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)**

**What it is:**  
A standard by OMG for language-agnostic, distributed object communication using an Object Request Broker (ORB).

**How it works:**

- Uses IDL (Interface Definition Language) to define interfaces.
    
- ORBs generate stubs/skeletons for multiple programming languages.
    
- Supports synchronous/asynchronous calls.
    

**Use cases:**

- Large enterprise systems in finance, telecom, aerospace (more common in the 90s‚Äì2000s).
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- True cross-language support.
    
- Rich features (transactions, security, event handling).
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- Heavyweight and complex.
    
- Steep learning curve.
    
- Declining ecosystem‚Äîconsidered outdated compared to REST or gRPC.

## 3. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

**What it is:**  
An XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging structured data over HTTP, SMTP, or other transports.

**How it works:**

- Defines strict envelope structure.
    
- Uses WSDL for service definitions.
    
- Often combined with WS-* standards (e.g., WS-Security).
    

**Use cases:**

- Enterprise integrations, especially when formal contracts, reliability, and security are required (e.g., banking, government).
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Strong typing and formal contracts.
    
- Built-in error handling.
    
- Good for complex enterprise workflows.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- Verbose XML messages (high bandwidth).
    
- Harder to debug.
    
- Slower than REST or gRPC.

## 4. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

**What it is:**  
An architectural style using HTTP and stateless communication. Resources are represented with URLs, and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) define operations.

**How it works:**

- Resources identified by URIs.
    
- Uses JSON, XML, or others for payloads.
    
- Stateless and cache-friendly.
    

**Use cases:**

- Public APIs, microservices, web backends.
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Simple and widely adopted.
    
- Works with browsers and firewalls easily.
    
- Language-agnostic.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- Limited for real-time or complex querying.
    
- Can be inefficient for nested/related data (over-fetching or under-fetching).
    
- Lacks built-in schema enforcement.

## 5. **gRPC**

**What it is:**  
A modern, high-performance RPC framework from Google using HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.

**How it works:**

- Services defined in `.proto` files.
    
- Supports streaming (client, server, or bidirectional).
    
- Uses binary encoding for speed.
    

**Use cases:**

- Microservices, mobile backends, low-latency APIs, IoT.
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Extremely fast and efficient.
    
- Strongly typed contracts.
    
- Streaming support and multiplexing over HTTP/2.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- Less human-readable (binary payloads).
    
- Harder to debug without tools.
    
- Browser support requires gRPC-Web.

## 6. **Apache Thrift**

**What it is:**  
A cross-language RPC framework developed at Facebook, similar to gRPC but older and more flexible in transport/protocol choices.

**How it works:**

- IDL defines services and data types.
    
- Code generation for many languages.
    
- Supports multiple protocols (binary, compact) and transports.
    

**Use cases:**

- Polyglot microservices where performance and flexibility matter.
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Multi-language support.
    
- Tunable for performance and transport.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- More complex to configure.
    
- Less ecosystem momentum than gRPC.

## 7. **WebSockets**

**What it is:**  
A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

**How it works:**

- Starts as an HTTP handshake, then upgrades to WebSocket.
    
- Persistent connection enables server push and real-time messaging.
    

**Use cases:**

- Real-time apps (chat, gaming, live dashboards, collaborative tools).
    

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Low latency, bidirectional communication.
    
- Reduces overhead vs. repeated HTTP requests.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- More complex server infrastructure.
    
- Less cache-friendly.
    
- Can be overkill for simple request/response scenarios.

## 8. **GraphQL**

**What it is:**  
A query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook. Clients request exactly the data they need.

**How it works:**

- Single endpoint handles queries/mutations.
    
- Schema defines types and relationships.
    
- Supports subscriptions for real-time updates.
    

**Use cases:**

- Front-end heavy apps (e.g., SPAs, mobile) needing efficient data fetching.
    

**Trade-offs:**

## 9. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

**What it is:**  
A **newer protocol** (introduced by OpenAI in 2024) for structured communication between AI models and external tools or contexts. It allows a model to fetch external knowledge, use plugins, or integrate with workflows safely.

**How it works:**

- Defines a JSON-based standard for exchanging messages between the model and external systems.
    
- Focuses on discoverability and secure execution.
    
- Designed for multi-tool orchestration.
    

**Use cases:**

**Trade-offs:**  
‚úÖ **Pros:**

- Purpose-built for AI toolchains.
    
- Secure and structured.
    
- Encourages modular, extensible architectures.
    

‚ùå **Cons:**

- Early-stage ecosystem.
    
- Limited adoption outside AI agent frameworks.
    
- Evolving specification means potential breaking changes.
