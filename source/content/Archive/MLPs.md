#### **1. Introduction to Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)**  
- **Feedforward Architecture**: MLPs consist of **input**, **hidden**, and **output** layers.  
- **Common Structure**: A "two-layer" network (one hidden layer) is widely used for tasks like **regression** and **classification**.  
- **Nonlinear Mapping**: The network transforms inputs to outputs via **weighted connections** and **activation functions** (e.g., `tanh`, `sigmoid`).  

#### **2. Function Approximation in MLPs**  
- **Random Weight Exploration**:  
  - Functions generated by random weights vary in complexity based on weight magnitudes (`σ_bias`, `σ_in`, `σ_out`).  
  - Larger weights → more complex, sensitive functions.  
  - **Key Insight**: Function complexity depends on **weight scale**, not just the number of hidden units.  
- **Example**: A 2-input MLP can model **nonlinear surfaces** (unlike linear regression, which only fits flat planes).  

#### **3. Training MLPs (Traditional Approach)**  
- **Objective**: Minimize an **error function** (e.g., mean squared error for regression).  
- **Backpropagation**: Efficiently computes gradients via the **chain rule**.  
- **Regularization (Weight Decay)**:  
  - Added term (`αE_W`) penalizes large weights to **prevent overfitting**.  
  - Balances fitting data vs. keeping weights small.  

#### **4. Probabilistic Interpretation of Learning**  
- **Error Function as Likelihood**:  
  - Gaussian noise assumption ↔ sum-squared error.  
  - Binary classification ↔ cross-entropy loss.  
- **Prior Over Weights**:  
  - Regularization term ↔ Gaussian prior (`P(w|α)`).  
- **Bayesian Inference**:  
  - Training finds the **most probable weights** (`w_MP`) given data.  

#### **5. Bayesian Advantages for Model Control**  
- **Avoids Overfitting**: Optimizes **model complexity** via **evidence maximization** (no validation set needed).  
- **Handles Uncertainty**: Provides **error bars** on predictions 
- **Adaptive Regularization**: Hyperparameters (e.g., `α`, `β`) can be tuned **automatically**.  

#### **6. Extensions & Advanced Topics**  
- **Classification Networks**:  
  - **Softmax output** for multi-class tasks.  
- **Relevance Determination**: Bayesian methods can **prune irrelevant inputs** by inferring weight importance.  
- **Scalable Inference**:  
  - Monte Carlo sampling or Gaussian approximations for large networks.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- MLPs are **universal approximators** but require careful regularization.  
- **Bayesian methods** improve robustness by:  
  - Automating complexity control.  
  - Quantifying uncertainty.  
- **Modern relevance**: Though largely replaced by deep learning, MLPs laid the foundation for **backpropagation** and **probabilistic neural networks**.
