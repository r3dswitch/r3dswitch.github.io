"How to Heart," is dedicated to the partners, family, and friends of individuals with ADHD, whom the author affectionately calls "Hearts." The chapter explores the unique challenges of being in a relationship with someone with ADHD, drawing from the author's personal experiences. It addresses the common frustrations that Hearts experience, such as feeling like they have to manage their loved one's life, and the pain of unmet expectations. The chapter emphasizes that these struggles are not due to a lack of caring, but are a result of the neurological differences of ADHD. It discusses the concept of the "double empathy problem" within relationships and the importance of recognizing that progress is not linear. The toolbox section offers guidance for Hearts, including engaging in empathy, choosing battles wisely, collaborating on solutions, focusing on the positive, and practicing self-care. The chapter concludes with the author's personal story of learning to build a true partnership with her partner by creating a shared plan, rather than falling into a parent-child dynamic.
