"How to See Time," delves into the concept of 'time blindness' or 'time nearsightedness,' a common struggle for individuals with ADHD. The author recounts her personal difficulties with time management, highlighting the inability to accurately perceive the passage of time and estimate the duration of tasks. The chapter explains that this is a core deficit in ADHD, affecting the vast majority of those with the condition. It explores the neurological underpinnings of this issue, such as differences in temporal processing and shorter time horizons, which make future planning difficult. The chapter also discusses the tendency to forget to account for the small but necessary steps in any task, leading to chronic lateness. The toolbox section offers strategies to make time more concrete and manageable. These include building 'time wisdom' by tracking how long tasks actually take, using external timers and 'time pillars' to create structure, and communicating with others about time-related struggles. The chapter ends with the author's personal journey towards a more balanced approach to scheduling, moving away from a rigid, anxiety-inducing calendar to a more flexible system.
