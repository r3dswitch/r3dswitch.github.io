"How to Motivate Your Brain," explains that the ADHD brain is not motivated by what is important, but by what is stimulating. The author describes the constant battle between her intentions and her brain's lack of cooperation. The chapter details the core of ADHD motivation, which is driven by urgency, novelty, challenge, and personal interest. It delves into the role of dopamine in the ADHD brain, explaining that lower levels of this neurotransmitter make it difficult to get started on tasks that aren't inherently rewarding. The chapter introduces the concept of the "Wall of Awful," an emotional barrier created by past failures that can prevent task initiation. It also discusses how behaviors can precede motivation through behavioral activation. The toolbox offers strategies to increase motivation, such as adding urgency, finding the right level of challenge, and connecting tasks to personal interests. It also suggests ways to reduce the friction of starting a task, like preparing in advance and using enjoyable tools. The chapter concludes with the author's realization that self-compassion and understanding are more effective motivators than self-criticism.
