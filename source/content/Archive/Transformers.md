* What are Transformers?
       * Transformers are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle
         sequential data, like text, but have proven effective in many other
         domains as well (e.g., images, audio).
       * They transform a sequence of input vectors into a sequence of output
         vectors, aiming to create a richer, more context-aware representation of
         the data.
       * Their main advantage is the ability to handle long-range dependencies in
         data more effectively than previous architectures like Recurrent Neural
         Networks (RNNs).

   * Attention Mechanism:
       * The fundamental concept behind Transformers is attention, specifically
         self-attention.
       * Attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words (or
          tokens) in the input sequence when processing a particular word. The
         influence of other words is not fixed but depends on the context.
       * This is achieved by creating three vectors for each input token: a Query
         (Q), a Key (K), and a Value (V). The "attention score" between two tokens
          is calculated based on the similarity of the Query of the current token
         and the Key of another token. The output for a token is then a weighted
         sum of the Values of all tokens, where the weights are these attention
         scores.

  Key Architectural Components:

   * Scaled Dot-Product Attention: This is the core of the attention mechanism,
     where the dot products of the Query and Key vectors are scaled to prevent
     issues with gradients during training.
   * Multi-Head Attention: Instead of a single attention mechanism, Transformers
     use multiple "attention heads" in parallel. Each head can learn to focus on
     different types of relationships between words, making the model more
     powerful. The outputs of these heads are then combined.
   * Positional Encoding: Since the Transformer architecture itself doesn't
     inherently process the order of the sequence, positional information is
     added to the input embeddings. This is typically done using sine and cosine
     functions of different frequencies.
   * Transformer Layers: A full Transformer model is built by stacking multiple
     Transformer layers. Each layer consists of a multi-head attention mechanism
     followed by a feed-forward neural network. Residual connections and layer
     normalization are used to improve training stability and performance.

  Applications and Model Types:

   * Natural Language Processing (NLP):
       * Decoder-only models (e.g., GPT): These are autoregressive models that are
         excellent for text generation tasks. They use "masked" self-attention to
         ensure that when predicting a word, they only attend to the preceding
         words in the sequence.
       * Encoder-only models (e.g., BERT): These models are designed to build a
         deep bidirectional representation of a text by considering both the left
         and right context. They are often pre-trained on large amounts of text
         using tasks like predicting masked words and then fine-tuned for specific
          tasks like sentiment analysis or question answering.
       * Encoder-Decoder models: These are used for sequence-to-sequence tasks
         like machine translation, where an encoder processes the input sequence
         and a decoder generates the output sequence, with a "cross-attention"
         mechanism allowing the decoder to attend to the encoder's output.

   * Multimodal Transformers: The chapter also touches on the application of
     Transformers to other data types, such as:
       * Vision Transformers (ViT): For image processing, where an image is
         broken down into patches that are treated as a sequence of tokens.
       * Audio and other data types: Highlighting the versatility of the
         Transformer architecture.
