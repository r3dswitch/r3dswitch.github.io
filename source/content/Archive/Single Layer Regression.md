 **Linear Regression:**

* The chapter starts with the simplest form of regression, involving a linear combination of input variables.

* It then extends this to include **basis functions**, which allow for nonlinear relationships between the input and target variables. This is a crucial step towards more powerful models.

 **Likelihood and Error Functions:**

* The chapter explains how the **sum-of-squares error function**, a common choice for regression problems, can be derived from the principle of **maximum likelihood** under the assumption of Gaussian noise.

 **Maximum Likelihood Solution:**

* It derives the closed-form solution for the weights of a linear regression model, known as the **normal equations**.

* The geometrical interpretation of the least-squares solution as an orthogonal projection is also discussed.

 **Sequential Learning:**

* The chapter introduces the concept of **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** as an alternative to batch methods, which is particularly useful for large datasets.

 **Regularized Least Squares:**

* To address the problem of overfitting, the chapter introduces **regularization**, specifically the sum-of-squares regularizer, which is also known as **weight decay**.

 **Multiple Outputs:**

* The concepts of linear regression are extended to problems with multiple target variables.

 **Decision Theory:**

* The chapter revisits decision theory in the context of regression, introducing the **squared loss function** and showing that the optimal prediction is the conditional mean of the target data.

 **The Bias-Variance Trade-off:**

* This fundamental concept in machine learning is explained in detail. It describes the trade-off between the model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new data (low variance).
