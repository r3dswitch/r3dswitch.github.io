"How to Make ADHD Harder," discusses the complexities of ADHD when it intersects with other conditions and life circumstances. The author explains that the lived experience of ADHD is not monolithic and is often complicated by co-existing psychological, biological, and socio-environmental factors. The chapter details how neurodevelopmental conditions like Autism, as well as mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and trauma, can significantly alter the presentation and challenges of ADHD. It also explores the impact of biological factors such as hormones and age, and socio-environmental factors like culture, socioeconomic status, and access to care. The chapter emphasizes that these intersections can create unique and compounded difficulties. The toolbox section offers guidance on navigating this complexity, including the importance of getting an accurate diagnosis, thinking holistically about treatment, seeking out communities with shared experiences, and respecting one's individual journey. The chapter concludes with a reflection on the power of labels, arguing that while they can be stigmatizing, they can also be a gateway to understanding, support, and community.
