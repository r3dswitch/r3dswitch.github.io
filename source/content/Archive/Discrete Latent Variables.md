* Mixture Distributions: The chapter introduces mixture models, with a focus
     on Gaussian mixtures, as a way to represent complex distributions. These
     models are a linear combination of simpler Gaussian (or other)
     distributions.

   * K-means Clustering: This is presented as a non-probabilistic approach to
     clustering data. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest
      cluster center and then re-computes the centers. It is shown to be a special
      case of the EM algorithm applied to Gaussian mixtures under certain
     simplifying assumptions.

   * Latent Variables: The chapter provides a formal view of mixture models using
     discrete latent variables. Each latent variable corresponds to a component of
      the mixture, and its value indicates which component generated a given data
     point.

   * Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm: This is a powerful and general
     iterative algorithm for finding maximum likelihood solutions in models with
     latent variables. The chapter details the two steps:
       * E-step (Expectation): The posterior probabilities of the latent
         variables are calculated given the current model parameters. These are
         also referred to as "responsibilities".
       * M-step (Maximization): The model parameters are updated to maximize the
         expected complete-data log-likelihood, using the responsibilities
         calculated in the E-step.

   * Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO): The chapter provides a more general and
     rigorous derivation of the EM algorithm by introducing the ELBO. Maximizing
     the ELBO is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the observed data.

   * Mixtures of Bernoulli Distributions: The concepts are extended to discrete
     binary data using mixtures of Bernoulli distributions, also known as latent
     class analysis.
