 **Limitations of Fixed Basis Functions:**

* Discusses the challenges of using fixed basis functions, especially in high-dimensional spaces, leading to the concept of the **curse of dimensionality**.

* Introduces the idea of **data manifolds**, where real-world data often lies on lower-dimensional subspaces within high-dimensional spaces.

* Highlights the need for **data-dependent basis functions** that can adapt to the underlying data structure.

 **Multilayer Networks:**

* Introduces the architecture of **multilayer networks** (also known as **multilayer perceptrons** or **feed-forward networks**), which consist of multiple layers of learnable parameters.

* Explains how these networks use **hidden units** with nonlinear **activation functions** to learn complex representations.

* Discusses the concept of **universal approximation**, stating that sufficiently large multilayer networks can approximate any continuous function.

* Covers **weight-space symmetries** that can lead to multiple equivalent weight vectors for the same network function.

 **Deep Networks:**

* Explores the advantages of **deep networks** (networks with many layers) over shallow ones, particularly their ability to learn **hierarchical representations**.

* Introduces **distributed representations**, where features are represented by combinations of hidden units.

* Explains **representation learning**, where the network learns to transform input data into semantically meaningful representations.

* Discusses **transfer learning**, where knowledge gained from one task is applied to another related task.

* Introduces **contrastive learning** as a method for learning representations by bringing similar data points closer and pushing dissimilar ones apart.

* Covers **general network architectures** for deep neural networks, emphasizing their feed-forward topology.

* Briefly touches upon **tensors** as higher-dimensional arrays used to represent data in deep learning.

 **Error Functions:**

* Revisits the concept of **error functions** (or loss functions) in the context of deep neural networks.

* Discusses error functions for **regression** (e.g., sum-of-squares error) and **binary/multiclass classification** (e.g., cross-entropy error).

* Introduces **mixture density networks** as a way for neural networks to model more general conditional probability distributions, particularly multimodal ones.
