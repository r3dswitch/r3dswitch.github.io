# November 2025 Review

The month of November was a busy and productive one, with a strong focus on professional development, networking, and personal projects.

A significant portion of the month was dedicated to "Aethos," with activities including meeting prep, research setup, and onboarding. There were also several meetings with academic and professional contacts, including Sven from BIH, Claudia from FU Berlin, and Georg. These meetings seem to be related to research proposals and collaborations.

There was a lot of activity around job seeking and career development, including a "Sunrise robotics interview", and signing up for a workshop on "Wages for Founders and Early Employees at Merantix". The user also worked on a "Popcorn Deck" and submitted it.

Personal projects were also a major theme. The user spent a lot of time working on a website, including creative work on design and CSS, and making updates. "Project Euler" problems were solved on multiple days. The user also published several "Hard Things" articles.

Reading was a consistent activity, with "Magic Mountain" being read throughout the month. The user also read "Glenn Ganges".

Social and personal activities included meeting with friends like Pratim and Shloka, calling family, and attending a live performance. There was also a therapy session and a call with Rinika that the user noted as significant.

The end of the month saw preparations for winter, and a trip to Munich to sort out an exam registration issue.

Overall, November was a month of intense activity across multiple fronts, with a clear focus on building a career, pursuing personal projects, and maintaining social connections.
