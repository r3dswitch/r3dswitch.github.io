- Anna Interview
	- 1. **Background & Motivation**
    
    - **Current Practice Workflow**
    
    - Anna works in a **general and diabetology practice**.
        
    - Typical chronic wounds: **venous ulcers (CVI)** and **peripheral arterial disease (PAVK)**, fewer diabetic foot ulcers.
        
    - Patients with chronic wounds are usually scheduled **every 2–3 days**.
        
    - Wound care is **time-intensive**: includes patient conversation, full anamnesis (medical and social), wound cleaning, treating surrounding skin, and documentation.
        
    - Acute wounds (cuts, burns) are often handled jointly with a doctor.
        
2. **Documentation & Tools**
    
    - Documentation is done **digitally** in the **Tomo** practice management system (no special wound documentation module).
        
    - Photos of wounds are taken with a **dedicated practice phone** linked to the system.
        
    - Measurements are performed **manually with a ruler** (length, width, depth). No use of advanced measurement tools (e.g., fluid displacement).
        
3. **Billing & Reimbursement**
    
    - For **public insurance patients**, wound care beyond the basic consultation is **poorly reimbursed**—sometimes no extra payment for complex dressing changes.
        
    - **Private patients** allow more flexible billing (size/type of wound matters).
        
    - Doctors handle most billing. Home visits are performed by doctors, not Anna.
        
4. **Pain Points / Inefficiencies**
    
    - **Time pressure and perception by colleagues**: lengthy wound care can cause scheduling conflicts and stress.
        
    - **Scheduling bottlenecks**: only one treatment room; if multiple doctors schedule wound patients at the same time, waiting times grow.
        
    - **Desire for automation**: appointment scheduling could be smarter; wound measurement and documentation could be faster and more consistent.
        
5. **External Benchmarks**
    
    - Anna observed **Wundex** (home-visit wound care service) using **digital documentation and automated wound measurement** via smartphone apps—she found this highly efficient and impressive.
        
6. **Professional Development**
    
    - Anna would like to gain broader experience in hospitals or dermatology to complement her practice-only perspective. She values learning from colleagues with university hospital backgrounds.
        
7. **Next Steps**
    
    - Marlene will send Anna a short follow-up survey.
        
    - Anna is open to further questions or calls.
