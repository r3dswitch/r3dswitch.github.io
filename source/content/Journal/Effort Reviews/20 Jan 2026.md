### Reframing Effort

This worksheet is for moments when you feel you are "not doing enough" despite sustained effort. The aim is not to feel better, perform better, or lower your standards. The aim is to remove unnecessary self- punishment so effort can remain sustainable.

### Name the Old Rule

Complete the sentence honestly, without correcting it:

-> Effort only counts if it: is done with intention and results in progress.

Briefly note where you learned this rule (family, scarcity, comparison, history, survival):

-> Scarcity and survival
### Describe Your Actual Effort (No Judgment)

Write this as if you were observing someone else. Stick to facts.

Time spent: 5 hrs

Level of focus: 70%

Constraints present: anxiety and time

What interrupted you? Feelings of inadequacy and distraction by other tasks

How did you respond? Abandoned work or switched to something else

When did you stop? Either when the work got done or when the work got too overwhelming to continue

### Accuracy Check (Not Self- Praise)

Answer briefly:

- Did you avoid the task entirely? Yes / No
-> No

- Did you engage while managing fear, fatigue, or pressure? Yes / No
-> Yes

If you answered "Yes" to the second question, note this:

Engaging under strain is still engagement.

### Introduce Compassion (Without Excuses)

Read this slowly and choose one sentence to complete:

Given my current capacity, history, and nervous system state, this level of effort was

Okay.

I do not need to punish myself to justify this effort.

### Reframe the Meaning of 60–70%

60–70% effort can mean:- Staying engaged without collapse

- Preserving energy for continuity

- Choosing proportion over punishment

Complete:

Today, stopping at this level protected: my energy enough to continue the next day.

Compassion here does not mean lowering standards. It means removing cruelty so effort can continue.

Reframe choices to work as:

“Chosen under constraint or fear” ≠ “inauthentic”

Fear does not cancel agency

Use language shift: From “I did this because I was anxious” To “I chose this while anxious”
