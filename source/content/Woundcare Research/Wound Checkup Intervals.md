### ⏱️ 1. Referral to Wound Care Team

A German cohort study found that the **median time between a patient’s first healthcare contact and their first appointment with a specialized wound-care team was 41 days** (interquartile range: 22–80 days, range: 1–484 days) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9680184/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Cohort study of diagnostic delay in the clinical pathway of patients ...")). This indicates significant delays before patients access specialist wound management.

### 🔄 2. Guided by Treatment Protocols

- According to DAK-Gesundheit’s 2024 report, integrated care contracts aim to shorten time to stable wound closure—but specific check-up intervals aren’t standardly reported in publicly available data ([caas.content.dak.de](https://caas.content.dak.de/caas/v1/media/86682/data/5420fe7fee043eb318f60327035197e9/versorgungsreport-2024-chronische-wunden-report.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] versorgungsreport-2024-chronische-wunden ... - DAK-Gesundheit")).
    
- Clinical guidelines (S3-level) for chronic wound care stress that wounds failing to heal by **40–50% after four weeks** should be considered for escalation ([magonlinelibrary.com](https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/10.12968/jowc.2019.28.Sup3a.S1?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Implementing TIMERS: the race against hard-to-heal wounds")).

### 🗓️ 3. Recommended Monitoring Frequency

While explicit German check-up averages are sparsely documented, international best-practice protocols suggest:

|Wound Status|Recommended Review Interval|
|---|---|
|**Initial treatment phase**|Once weekly|
|**Stable, healing wounds**|Every 1–2 weeks|
|**Non-healing after 4 weeks**|More frequent reviews; evaluation of escalation|

Guidelines emphasize that if a wound shows less than 40–50% healing after 4 weeks, intervention adjustments or specialized care should follow promptly ([register.awmf.org](https://register.awmf.org/assets/guidelines/091-001m_S3_Lokaltherapie-schwerheilender-chronischer-Wunden_2023-11.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Leitlinienreport - AWMF Leitlinien"), [dgpraec.de](https://www.dgpraec.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/091-001l_S3_Lokaltherapie_chronischer_Wunden_2012-ungueltig.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Lokaltherapie chronischer Wunden bei Patienten mit den Risiken ..."), [magonlinelibrary.com](https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/10.12968/jowc.2019.28.Sup3a.S1?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Implementing TIMERS: the race against hard-to-heal wounds"), [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/4/1003?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Risk Factors for Non-Healing Wounds—A Single-Centre Study - MDPI")).

### ✅ Summary

- 📌 **Median delay to first specialist review**: ~41 days post initial contact .
    
- 📌 **Guideline-driven check-ups**: often **weekly at the start**, moving to **bi-weekly** as healing progresses .
    
- 📌 Patients with slow-healing wounds require **more frequent reassessment**, typically after 4 weeks, to prevent stagnation.
