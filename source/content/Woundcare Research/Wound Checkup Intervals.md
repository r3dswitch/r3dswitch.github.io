### ⏱️ 1. Referral to Wound Care Team

A German cohort study found that the **median time between a patient’s first healthcare contact and their first appointment with a specialized wound-care team was 41 days** (interquartile range: 22–80 days, range: 1–484 days). This indicates significant delays before patients access specialist wound management.

### 🔄 2. Guided by Treatment Protocols

- According to DAK-Gesundheit’s 2024 report, integrated care contracts aim to shorten time to stable wound closure—but specific check-up intervals aren’t standardly reported in publicly available data.
    
- Clinical guidelines (S3-level) for chronic wound care stress that wounds failing to heal by **40–50% after four weeks** should be considered for escalation.

### 🗓️ 3. Recommended Monitoring Frequency

While explicit German check-up averages are sparsely documented, international best-practice protocols suggest:

|Wound Status|Recommended Review Interval|
|---|---|
|**Initial treatment phase**|Once weekly|
|**Stable, healing wounds**|Every 1–2 weeks|
|**Non-healing after 4 weeks**|More frequent reviews; evaluation of escalation|

Guidelines emphasize that if a wound shows less than 40–50% healing after 4 weeks, intervention adjustments or specialized care should follow promptly.

### ✅ Summary

- 📌 **Median delay to first specialist review**: ~41 days post initial contact .
    
- 📌 **Guideline-driven check-ups**: often **weekly at the start**, moving to **bi-weekly** as healing progresses .
    
- 📌 Patients with slow-healing wounds require **more frequent reassessment**, typically after 4 weeks, to prevent stagnation.
