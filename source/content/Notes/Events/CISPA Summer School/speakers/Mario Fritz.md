**Reasons for non-interpretability:**
- Speed
- Lack of training data
- Incapacity to process all evidence

**Approaches to interpretability:**
- Cognitive modelling
- Laws of thought
- Turing test
- Rational agents

**Most Systems:**
- End to End
- Many Parameters and Representation Learning
- Visual Turing Test

**Why Foundational Models:**
- Task Generalisation
- Scaling Laws

**Cyber Threat Landscape:**
- MITRE Atlas
- OWASP Top 10
- COSAI
- Papernot'16 SoK, CIA Triade

**Challenges:**
- Scaling Security is a big challenge

**Future Directions:**
- ctf.spylab.ai
- codeLMSec
- Representation Engineering
- Hallucinations through activation functions
- AI 2027
