### Battista Biggio

Battista Biggio is a Full Professor at the University of Cagliari in Italy and a co-founder of the cybersecurity company Pluribus One. His work focuses on machine learning and pattern recognition, particularly in the area of security. He has received recognition for his pioneering contributions to adversarial machine learning.

**Adversarial ML History:**
- AISec Workshop 2004-2006
- 2012 ICML
- 2013 ECML Poison, Evasion Attacks
- Wild Patterns: Ten Years after adv ml 2018

**Evasion Attack:**
- Good word insertion, bad word alteration
- Detection of Malicious PDF: Space of good vs bad, followed by optimisation to misclassification
- Nicolas Carlini adversarial landscape

**Challenges for AI/ML Testing:**
- Certified vs Empirical Robustness
- Obfuscated Gradients: not effective
- Indicators of Attack Failure as Semi Automated Framework
- Wrong PGD Attack Implementations
- Attack Bench
- sigma-zero paper, change label with lowest number of changes
- Mal-Conv: CNN for malware detection and attacks on it using bit manipulation injections
- saiferlab.ai

**Robust Optimisation Problem:**
- Regularisation as Noise(bounded perturbation to dual norm of perturbation)

**Denial of Service Poisoning Attacks:**
- Gradient Based Poisoning Attacks(Scaling not good)

**Backdoor Poisoning**

**Wild Patterns for LLM Security/ Gen AI:**
- Jailbreak Chat
- NVIDIA GARAK
- Encoding, Sandwich Attacks
- Gradient Based Optimisation of Adversarial Suffixes
- Weight Orthogonalisation
- Latent Break for Perplexity Filters

**Conclusion:**
- Adversarial ML Problems are Getting Harder to Solve and Evaluate
