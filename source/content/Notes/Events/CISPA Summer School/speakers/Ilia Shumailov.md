**What is the thing hiding behind my model**

> The worst enemy of security is complexity, Bruce Schneider

- Log4j vulnerability
- How many people sandbox their ML code when running locally? hf trust remote code flag

**Data, Architecture, Compiler, Runtime Components**
- Pytorch nightly compromise
- Securing CI/CD is super hard, pytorch breached
- Imagenet dataset with malware

**Supply Chain Attacks in ML Frameworks**
- Number of dependencies for ML frameworks is crazy

**ML Backdoors**
- Compromised Dependencies
- Direct Weight Manipulation

**Architectural Backdoors in Neural Networks**
- ONNX Graph Vis
- Architectural Neural Backdoors from First Principles
- Hidden Layer Company: Signing Graphs
- Choice of Architecture and Model super subjective wrt coding style and preferences
- Humans indifferent to backdoors
- Magical Numbers a big problem
- Hjel2/userstudy on github

**Defenses:**
- Blocklisting
- Provenance
- Architecture Obfuscation
- ImpNet

**Poisoning Web-Scale Training Datasets is Practical**

**Quantization Backdoors**

**On Trusting Trust: Ken Thompson**
