**Secure Design Patterns for LLMs**

- Dual LLM Pattern(Previledged and Quarantined LLM)
- Code-the-Execute Pattern
- Camel Paper (ETH)
- Information Flow Control
- Context Minimisation Pattern
- Highlight and Summarise

**Open Questions:**
- Where else can we use secure design patterns?
- How do we combine probabilistic and system level defenses?
- How do we get informed user approval?
- What new secure design patterns can we build?
- AI for vulnerability detection startups
