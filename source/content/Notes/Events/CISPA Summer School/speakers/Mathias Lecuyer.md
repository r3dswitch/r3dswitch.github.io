**f-DP**
- DP as a bound on hypothesis test's power
- Key Properties of f-DP:
    - Gaussian Mechanism
    - Post processing still f-DP
    - Composition
- Power of adversary as a bound between norm 2 and norm infinity

**Robustness**
- How to make models robust with guarantees?
- Proving robustness using f-DP type 2 errors using hypothesis testing
- Problems(Randomised Smoothing): noise degrades accuracy, difficulty scaling
- Solution: Adaptive Randomised Smoothing
- Provable input adaptive adversarial robustness with adaptive randomised smoothing
- DP Guided Diffusion Denoising

**Data Leakage**
- Measuring data leakage without access to out-of-distribution data with panorama
- Lee-Luda Chatbot
- Memorisation big problem
